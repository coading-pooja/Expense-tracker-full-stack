frontend side story....
show the leaderboard button - Dom manipulation
when u click on this button an api call should happened
you will get the data in sorted order from backend
Do dom manipulation and show the data.

backside story...
create a new route -> /premium/leaderboard
find all the expense and then group by unique userid
i need name of the user as well
query the user table and you will get all the id and username.
in this you are running 2 queries it would make everything slow

solution is join two tables
